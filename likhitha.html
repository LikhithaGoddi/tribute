                    Great men and eminent men have monuments in bronze and marble set up for them, but this man
                    of divine fire managed in his life-time to become enmeshed in millions and millions of hearts
                    so that all of us became somewhat of the stuff that he was made of, though to an infinitely
                    lesser degree. He spread out over India not in places only, or in select places, or in assemblies,
                    but in every hamlet and hurt of the lowly and those who suffer. He lives in the hearts of millions
                    of and he will live for immortal ages.

                    For even though his mortal frame will turn into ashes tomorrow, at 4.00 pm, Gandhiji's
                    imperishable teachings will abide with us. I even feel that Gandhiji's immortal spirit is still
                    hovering over us and will continue to watch over the nation's destiny in future also.
                    The mad youth who killed him was wrong if he thought thereby he was destroying his noble mission.
                    Perhaps God wanted Gandhiji's mission to fulfill and prosper through his death.

                    No one could die a more glorious death than Mahatma Gandhi. He was going to the seat of his prayer
                    to speak to his Rama. He did not die in the bed calling for hot water, doctors or nurses. He did
                    not die after mumbling incoherent words in the sick bed. He died standing, not even sitting down,
                    Rama was too eager to take him even before he could reach the seat of his prayer.

                    <b>Mrs. Sarojini Naidu</b>

                    Mahatma Gandhi, whose frail body was committed to the flames yesterday, is not dead. It was
                    right that the cremation took place in the midst of the dead kings who were buried in Delhi,
                    for he was the kingliest of all kings. It is right also that he who was the Apostle of Peace
                    should have been taken to the cremation ground with all the honours of a great warrior.
                    Far greater than all the warriors who led the armies to battle was this little man, the bravest,
                    the most tried friend of all. Delhi has become the centre and sanctuary of the great revolutionary
                    who emancipated his enslave country from foreign bondage and gave it to its freedom and its flag.
